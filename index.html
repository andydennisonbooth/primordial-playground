        is a "zero-player game" based on the following rules for a cellular automoton:

        <ol>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
